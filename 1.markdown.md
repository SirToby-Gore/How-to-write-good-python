# Starting Questions
* What does **MD** stand for?
    - markdown

* What does **markdown** become?
    - rendered html code

* Where does **markdown** get used by default?
    - README.md(s)
    - documentation

# Getting set up
1. Open command prompt
    * do on of the following
        - press the windows key
        - **OR**
        - use the keyboard shortcut
            + windows + e : to open explorer
        - then in the top bar with the file path put your cursor there
    * type **"cmd"**
    * press **Return**

2. create a .md file
```bash
# bash

mkdir learning-MD # make the directory "learning-MD"
cd learning-MD # changes the directory to "./learning-MD"
mkdir learning-the-syntax
cd learning-the-syntax
```

3. Open the file
```bash
# bash

code . # code will open VScode, adding a path like ./ or in short . will open VScode as workbook in that location
```

4. Open the vscode terminal
    * press ctrl + ' : to toggle the the terminal
    * run the following command
```bash
# bash

code learning-markdown.md # opens the file "leaning-markdown.md" in a new tab, if a file under that name does not exists VScode creates one under that name
```

5. Type out the following
```markdown
> markdown

# this is a header
This is some text
*italics*
**bold**
***very important***
```

6. Now use the keyboard command
    - ctrl + shift + v : to open markdown preview

7. Return back to the tab in the keyboard shortcut
    - ctrl + tab : to open the tab menu

8. Install the extension
    - use the keyboard shortcut 
        + ctrl + shift + x : to open extensions sidebar
    - type
        + `Docs View`
        * this will allow you to see the documentation of what every you are using in the side bar
        + and install the first extension
    - use the keyboard shortcut 
        + ctrl + shift + e : to open the explorer sidebar
    - expand the `documentation` tab
    - using your mouse drag the documentation to a blank spot on your side so that you can have a dedicated place to put it

    - I'd also recommend in your own time installing the following
        + `better comments` for better comments in C style languages
        + `code snap shot` for taking screen shots of code
        + `color stamp` or `peacock` to change the colour of your VScode workspace, helpful when in multiple windows
        + `csv to table` turns a csv into a an ascii table
        + `error lense` shows errors on the line that they occur
        + `material icon theme` I think I makes the `Explorer` side bar much nicer
        + `one dark pro` the best syntax theme for VScode 
        + `path intellisense` for VScode to see paths
        + `prettier` formats your code on saving
    - use the the keyboard shortcut
        + ctrl + b :  to open and close the side bar

# Learning Markdown syntax
Markdown file are just fancy text files that have additional features

You can write just plain text.

# Making a heading
To make a header you prefix the line with `#`s use between 1 and 6 for different sized headings 1 is the biggest, 6 the smallest.
```markdown
> markdown

# This is big header
### This is smaller header
###### This is a very small header
```

# Text styles pt.i (italics & bold)
You can make text *italic* by wrapping the word or phrase in `*` before and after with no white space.
```markdown
> markdown

*italic*
*this is phrase is in italic*
*this is not in italic *
```
The same idea for **bold** with `**` rather than just one `*`.
You can also have ***very important*** text with `***` which is juts italics + bold text

# Lists
There are different types of lists ordered and un-ordered.
Ordered list are done with numbers or letters.
Un-ordered lists do not have specific order.
When making a point you must add white space between the buller point and the text.

Both lists have a range of 3 levels of indentation
* Level 1 will have solid circular bullet point, defined with an `*`
1. Or a number, done with a `1.`
    - Level 2 will have hollow circular bullet point, done with a `-`
    1. Or a roman numeral, done with a `1.`
        * Level 3 will have a solid square buller point, done with a `+`
        1. Or a letter of the alphabet, done with a `1.`

You can mix and match lists on different levels and they will match up,
With a few exceptions.

```markdown
> markdown

* this is a buller point
    - this is a sub buller point
        + this is nested in here
    - this is a different nesting
        1. some more nesting
            + can evan nest here
                1. this is just crazy
                2. this is the second ordered bullet point
                12353. this is the third item
                3832323232. it does not matter what the numbers as along as each is bigger than the on before and the numbers start from the first numbered point

1. this is a numbered list
    1. this is itself nested
        1. and the third level of which
```

# Text formatting pt.ii (code blocks)
You can write code into your markdown files with syntax highlighting in code blocks.
Or you can you `inline` code block.

> A stylistic choice of mine is to include the language at the top of the code block in a comment and then an empty line.
```python
# python

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

To write a code block use the following
````
```you language (e.g. python, markdown, java)
your code
goes here
```
````

To use `inline` code wrap your text or phrase in backticks **`** found above the tab key on your keyboard on windows.

# Text formatting pt.iii (Comments visible and not)
Markdown gets rendered into html the way to write comments that rendered version can not see you make a html comment.
```html
<!-- html -->

<!-- this is a comment in html -->
```

To make a comment `<!---->` is the tag that you use then put you text in the middle of the two sets of double hyphens.

> To make a back-quote/comment in markdown, use the `>` in markdown

```markdown
> markdown

> This is a markdown back-quote/comment
```

# Links
You can make internal links and external links in markdown [this is link](https://google.com)
You make link with two adjacent sets of brackets the first set uses square brackets and the second set uses round brackets.
The first defines the text and the second defines the link URL.
```markdown
> markdown

[this is an external link](https://google.com)
[this is a local/internal link](../examples/file-location.ext)
```

# HTML Tags
use `<hr>` for a horizontal line
use `<br>` for a new line
* only where you can not put a new line or a line break because of flow
use `<img src="./path-to-image" alt="this is an image">` for an image however most markdown places do no support img tags.


# Practice
Can you make a quick little blog about yourself using markdown?
* It should have a title (about me?)
* Subtitles
    - Your name?
    - Where you live?
    - Favorite foods?
    - Hobbies?
    - Links to a social media?
    - Your national ID?
    - Your credit card numbers?
