# Starting questions
* What are doc strings?
    - documentation for a function, class, or file
    - in C style langs you can add a comment above a var to add docs to it

* What does it look like in python?
    - a string that starts with three double quotes at the top of one of the previous

* Why use doc strings?
    - they make code bases easier to use and read
    - most IDEs pick up doc strings an not comments
    - doc strings have become the standard way to document code

# Install an extension
`auto docstring`
Used for making docstring template in python.

# First off Python Docs
Using python docs is easy.
You use a multiline string defined with 3 quotes either single `'` or double `"`,
You should use double quotes for doc strings and reserve single quotes for strings.
If you need to use quotes in your string that would close the string, prefix the enclosed quote with a backslash `\`.

where you put python docs is very specific
```python
# python

"""
# These are some docs for the whole file
"""

class Calculator:
    """
    # These are some docs for the class `Calculator`
    This class holds a collection of methods for arithmetic operation
    """
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """
        # These are some docs for the method `add()`
        This adds a and b together and returns the sum of their two values.

        # args
        * a
            - int
        * b
            - int
        
        # returns
            - int
        """
        return a + b
```

# When you get to marvel at your creations
You can see the doc strings in VScode when:
* you hover over the item's name anywhere in the file
* when calling the item
* you use the shortcut 
    - ctrl + shift + space :  to open documentation
    - use
        + ctrl + space : to open suggestions anywhere
* you can also see it in `Explorer` side bar under documentation tab

Too see a files documentation in python by hovering over it, you need to import it in another file.
```python 
# python

# hover over time (what ever you called your other python file without the extension)
import time

# you can hover over either of the following to see their documentation
time.sleep()

# you can still both their docs by hovering over either
from time import sleep

sleep()
```

# For Your README.md
In your readme most .git places like github or bitbucket will render you README.md for you so that it opens at the top level of the repo.

You just write what your module does and how to use it in your readme.
This is often not needed in most small projects.

# Use in c style languages
C styles languages are also known as curly brace syntax but they are not the same.

Examples of C styles langs
* Java
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* C++/C
* C#
* Rust
* Sass/Scss

You use `///` to make a single line documentation
Or for multiline start with `/**` then on each line ` *` a space then a `*`, finishing as you normally would with a ` */` with an extra space before.

```javascript
// JavaScript

/// This is `script.js` and contains the class `Duck`

/**
 * # Class `Duck`
 * # Constructor
 * * args
 *      - family
 *          + this is the family of duck the duck belongs too
 * 
 * # Methods
 * * `quack()`
 */
class Duck {
    constructor(family) {
        this.family = family;
    }

    /**
     * # Method `quack`
     * This takes no arguments.
     * 
     * This makes the `Duck` output **quack to standard out**
     */
    quack() {
        console.log('Quack!');
    }
}
```

# Some quirks of VS code's markdown
> this is only applicable to docs in VS code, not to markdown files
```python
# python

def spam() -> any:
    """
    # This is a docstring
    This is a new line as the above has a line prefix
    This is not on a new line, as this nor the above lines has a line prefix.

    This is on a new line as there is whitespace between this and the above line
    ```
    # you do not need to specify the language from the language it is written in

    def eggs() -> None:
        ...
    ```
    """
```
