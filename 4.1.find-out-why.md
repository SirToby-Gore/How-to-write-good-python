# First stage (creation)
Make a program that does a thing, perhaps on of the following or something simple?
* A maths class
    - addition
    - subtraction
    - division
    - multiplication
    - area of a circle calculator
* A story game
    - 4 rooms
    - each with 4 options
    - each option has a description
* Game or rock, paper, scissors
* Game of 21
    - users select a number between 1 - 3
    - the computer selects a number between 1 - 3
        + selects the number randomly
    - the looser is the first one to count to or above 21

Then find a friend and send the code over to them and have them do the same.

# Second stage (review)
You have just traded files with you friend. 
Now look at their code, no need to run it.
Look at their code and review it.
Add comments like so `# ! <comment>` on what you have to say about a line of code or docs.

# Third stage (revision)
You send back the renewed file and they do the same.
Go over your code and make the suitable changes.

# Fourth stage (final revision)
